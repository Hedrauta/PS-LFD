# PS-LFD

Simple LFD (Login Failure Daemon) for Microsoft Powershell... May work only on PS5.1+

First commit only german language and preset settings (7 Days ban after 2 failed logins, 10 sec sleep between check).

WIP:
- Ask Settings on Startup ( number of failed logins, time of ban, sleep-duration between checkups, permanent ban?)
- Save Setting from Asking ( rewrite the file that we started.... :thinking: )
- ~~English language ( i don't do multilanguage )~~
- Optimize Code ( Fulltime-Job )

Ideas: 
- Filter Weblogs ( probably only IIS-Server )
- Filter SQL-Logs ( ye, like the LFD-module from CSF )
- ~~Optimize Code~~
